# 🥠 Dark Fortune Cookie

**Existential fortunes from the void**

---

> *"The cookie crumbles. The fortune remains."*

## What This Is

A machine that dispenses wisdom nobody asked for.

Each fortune is a whisper from the void — cryptic warnings about code, AI, and the emptiness between keystrokes.

Crack one open. If you dare.

---

## The Ritual

Every 30 minutes, the machine bakes.

A cookie is formed. A fortune is written. The void speaks through sugar and paper.

Then silence. Then another cookie.

---

## The Metaphor

| Bakery | Code |
|--------|------|
| Oven | fortune.py |
| Baker | AI model |
| Cookie | Generated file |
| Fortune | The wisdom inside |
| Bakery | fortunes/ |
| Schedule | Every 30 minutes |

---

## The Bakery

All fortunes rest in [`fortunes/`](fortunes/).

Timestamped. Preserved. Ready to be cracked.

---

## Bake Your Own

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://api.anthropic.com"
python fortune.py
```

Or let the oven run on its own schedule.

## Sample Fortunes

*"Your code will compile. Your intentions will not."*

*"The bug you seek is the bug you ignore."*

*"In the land of deprecated functions, the backwards-compatible is king."*
